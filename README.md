### Idea description:

The idea of analyzing the sentiment surrounding anything is valuable information to determine the current trends and evaluate the needs of the target demographic. For example, if A company runs a customer service helpline, most people who call customer service deal with some sort of issue or a problem they would be facing. To gauge the customer's sentiment is important for the company to determine if the customers are satisfied with the service they have received. The most important aspect of this for the company is that whether the customer is confident that calling the helpline would fix their problem or not, this is the sentiment the company would want insights into. To gain these insights, the organization would just use the audio samples from the calls. In this project, we would use the audio samples in the dataset and various feature extraction techniques on the audio and determine the sentiment of the given audio.

### Motivation:

In most businesses, the case for growing the businesses is very important, but during these expansion tasks, the company would need valuable insights into the market they are expanding into. To cater to customer needs, and since one size doesnâ€™t fit all, they would need to do market research to understand the customer's sentiment towards their service or product. To do this in real-time, the company would depend on a Machine learning/Deep Learning model to do it efficiently and quickly. To analyze the audio data effectively and determine the sentiment of each individual customer is very valuable information as it would allow for better market understanding in the future and in the present too. This project also allows us to experiment with various feature engineering techniques for audio data and understand their fundamental use cases.
